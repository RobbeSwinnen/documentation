Welcome to the Logging feature documentation! With Logging, you can easily keep track of all the important actions happening on your server, from user changes to server modifications and even moderation logs. This guide will provide you with detailed instructions on how to set up and customize the Logging feature to fit your needs.

### Setting Up Logging
To get started with Logging, first, you need to set it up. You can do this by following these simple steps:

- Look for the log type you want to set up and click on the "No channel set" text.
- Choose a channel from the list and save changes.
- To edit multiple log types at once, tick the boxes on the left. Then either choose "Set channel" or "Remove channel," including the channel, and apply and save your changes.

You can also filter log types next to the search bar after names, channels, or categories. If you want to remove a log type, hover over the channel name and then click the X symbol.

If you want to ignore embeds from message logging, you can easily do so by selecting the appropriate option.

### Ignoring Users, Roles, and Channels
You can also exclude certain users, roles, and channels from being logged. To do so, simply select the roles, users, or channels that you want to ignore.

Keep in mind that bots are always ignored from logging to avoid breaking Discord's Terms of Service. This prevents an infinite loop from occurring.

### Editing the Log Message
Every log message can be fully edited to suit your preferences. To edit a log message, go to the Messages module, and under the "Default messages" section, start typing in "log." Every log message starts with "log." Click on the log message you want to edit, switch to the Edit tab, and then make your desired changes.

### Don't Know What Log XY Does?
If you're unsure what a particular log type does, go to the Messages module, and search for that log type. Perhaps you can derive its purpose from the message. If not, don't hesitate to join our support channel and ask for assistance.
