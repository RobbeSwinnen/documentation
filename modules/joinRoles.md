Welcome to the Join Roles feature documentation. This feature is designed to automatically assign a specific role to new members joining your server. In this guide, we will explain how to use Join Roles and provide some tips to ensure its smooth operation.

To start using Join Roles, make sure that the "Sapphire" bot role is placed at the top of the roles list. This is important because if Sapphire is not placed above other roles, it may not be able to assign roles to new members.

Once you have arranged the roles list, you can proceed to the Join Roles settings. Here, you can choose to assign all roles listed in the box to every user that joins the server. Additionally, you can require users to pass a screening process before assigning them a role. This screening process will force users to accept the rules before they are assigned a role.

If you need to assign a specific role to a user, you can do so by adding their user ID in the User Join Roles field. You can also set a delay time in seconds before Sapphire assigns the user a role.

Furthermore, if Sapphire was offline or unable to assign roles at any point, you can use the Synchronization feature to assign all currently selected roles to every user in the server. This feature is especially useful when you want to assign every user a role at once.

To use the Synchronization feature, simply select the roles you want to assign and click on the "Synchronize" button. You can also use the s!jr sync command to achieve the same result.
