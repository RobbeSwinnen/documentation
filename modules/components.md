### Creating Custom Buttons
To create a custom button, simply navigate to the Components module and select the "Custom Buttons" section. Enter a name for your button and click "Create." You can now add actions to your button by clicking the "+" symbol and configuring them using the gear icon. These actions will be executed once your button is pressed.

To add your button to a message, go to the Messages module and select your template. Click on the "+ Action Row" option, then select "Button." You can now select the action you created earlier and customize the button's appearance by changing its color, turning it into a link button, adding an emoji, or giving it a label.
