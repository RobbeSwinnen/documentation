Welcome to Sapphire's Social Media Notifications feature! This module allows you to receive notifications for new videos, live streams, and posts on YouTube, Twitch, and Twitter. The best part? You can fully customize the messages you receive!

Let's start with YouTube. To receive YouTube notifications, you'll need to add the user ID (not the username) of the channel you want to follow. There are several ways to obtain the user ID, including checking the URL of the channel or using a website like "getchannelid.com". Note that legacy username IDs cannot be used and that only randomly generated channel IDs work with Sapphire.

To set up Twitch notifications, you'll need to connect your Twitch account with Sapphire. Simply type in your username, follow the on-screen instructions to connect your account, and you're all set! Note that this process must be done only once and is necessary for legal reasons.

To receive Twitter notifications, you'll need to connect your Twitter account with Sapphire in the same way as you did with Twitch. Type in your username, follow the on-screen instructions, and you're ready to go!

Once you've set up your notifications, you can choose which channels the messages should be sent to and which roles should be pinged when a message is sent. Simply click on the text "no channel set" or the speech bubble icon to choose a channel, and click on the gear icon to select which roles to ping.

And finally, if you want to edit the message content of your social media notifications, head over to the Messages module and search for "smn". Edit the corresponding message to your liking.
