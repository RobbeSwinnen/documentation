Welcome to the Reaction Roles feature! With this feature, you can allow users to assign themselves roles through message reactions. If you encounter any issues, feel free to join our community or watch our tutorial video.

Before you begin, ensure that the "Sapphire" bot role is placed above all other roles in the roles list. This is important because Sapphire will not be able to give users roles that are above it.

### Setting up Reaction Roles
To start setting up reaction roles, you need to decide if Sapphire should send a new message where all reactions are attached or if there is already a message in any channel that Sapphire will add the reactions to.

- Option 1: Use existing message
If you already have a message that you want the reactions to be added to, right-click on it and select "Copy Message Link". Then, paste the message link into the designated field.

- Option 2: Create new message
If you want to create a new message for reactions, select the channel that Sapphire will send the message in.

### Choose emojis and roles
Now it is time to choose which emojis will be used as reactions and which roles should be added.

- Adding emojis
Click on the plus icon and select the emoji that you want to use.

- Selecting roles
Next to the emoji, you will see a plus symbol with the text "No roles added". Click on it to add one or multiple roles that will be assigned to the user once they react with it. You can also select roles that will be removed once the user reacts with the emoji by clicking on the expanded arrows button.

When you select the "Create new message" option, the message will be sent after saving changes.

### Editing Your Message
To edit the message that Sapphire is sending, click on the "Edit message" button. An editor will open in that same window where you can edit your message.

### Options and Settings
There are options and settings that you can configure:

Reversed: When you enable this option, adding the reaction will remove roles and removing the reaction will assign roles to the user.

Maximum reactions per user: Sets the maximum amount of reactions a user can make on this message. If set to 0, users aren't limited in their reactions.

List mode: You can select between a blacklist and a whitelist. This option changes the list mode underneath. This way, you can blacklist or whitelist roles that should or should not be able to react.
