Welcome to the Text Commands module guide! Here, we will walk you through how to use this module to its full potential, including toggle commands, toggle slash commands, restrict them, create custom commands, and much more!

---

Let's start with the default commands. When you enter the "default commands" function, Sapphire will list all of its available commands. By hovering over each command, you can customize them to fit your preferences.

Next, let's dive into how to configure default and custom commands. You can add actions that will be executed after executing the command (custom commands only). You can also learn more about a command by using the "about" function. Furthermore, you can add different names for the same command by using the "aliases" function. If you need to limit commands to specific roles, permissions, or channels, use the "restrictions" function. Additionally, you can add a delete delay to a command by using the "delete delay" function. You can also control the timing of input and output by using the "input delay" and "output delay" functions. Finally, you can register commands as slash commands and control their visibility to users by using the "slash command" function.

If you need to create your own (slash) commands, the custom commands function is just for you! Simply type in a name for your custom command, and you're ready to add functionality to it. By hovering over your custom command and clicking on "actions", you can add actions that will be executed after the command is run.

Next up are prefixes. The default prefix for Sapphire is "s!" but you can add up to five different prefixes if you prefer.

Lastly, let's discuss error messages. By default, an error message will be sent to the channel when a user fails to enter a command correctly. If you prefer not to send error messages, you can toggle them off individually for each command.
