Welcome to the Automated Moderation feature guide! Here, we'll walk you through the steps on how to use the automated moderation module effectively.

Automated Moderation is a powerful feature that can detect specific words, message spam, too many mentions, attachments, emojis, links being sent, and more. You can define conditions and actions that will be executed automatically, such as banning users, deleting messages, adding roles, and more.

There are two categories of Automated Moderation: Discord's built-in Automated Moderation and Advanced Automated Moderation. Let's dive into each of them.

Discord's built-in automated moderation allows you to add additional actions that will be executed when Discord’s AutoMod is triggered. All AutoMod rules you’ve set up on your server show up on this page. This feature gives you more flexibility to enforce your server's rules and prevent unwanted behavior.

Advanced Automated Moderation, on the other hand, is Sapphire’s automated moderation system, which contains 10+ modules. These modules include Spam, Mentions, Attachments, Emojis, Message lines, Capitalization, Words, Links, Invites, Warns, and Special channels. Each of these modules allows you to take actions when specific conditions are met. For example, the Spam module takes actions when a user sends messages too fast, while the Links module takes actions when a user’s message includes links.

Setting up automated moderation modules is easy. To get started, add a condition and configure the requirements that need to be met. A condition works like this: How much .. (messages, attachments/..) in .. (time/how often/how much/..). Once you've set up your conditions, configure the actions that will be executed when the condition is triggered. Click on the + symbol and select an action, such as opening a moderation case or deleting the message.

In addition, you can ignore roles or channels that you do not want the automated moderation feature to apply to. To ignore roles, click the "Manage roles" button above the conditions. To ignore channels, click the # under the Add condition button.

Auto Moderation is a powerful tool that can help you maintain a healthy and safe server environment. By following these simple steps, you can easily set up your own automated moderation system and protect your server from unwanted behavior.
