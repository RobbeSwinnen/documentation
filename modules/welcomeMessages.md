Welcome to the guide on how to use the Welcome Messages feature! This feature allows you to send channel or DM messages on join, leave, boost, or role update, including dynamic images. If you ever need assistance, don't hesitate to join our support channel.

The process for adding messages and images is the same for all types. Let's get started!
!!!

### Step 1: Adding a Message
To add a message, simply click on "New message." Then, select a channel on the server or choose a direct message as the destination. Please note that Sapphire cannot send messages to already left users.

Next, create the message that you'd like to be sent using the message editor. Once you're done, save the changes and voila!

### Step 2: Dynamic Images (Optional)
With Sapphire's built-in visual image editor, you can create fully customizable and dynamically updating images to attach to your welcome messages.

To set up dynamic images, click on "New dynamic image." To use the default dynamic image and add it to a message, click on "Use in message," select the message, and choose a slot for the image.

If you want to edit the dynamic image, click on the "Edit image" icon. This will open a window that allows you to completely customize the dynamic image. Think of it as Photoshop, but simpler and within Sapphire!

Use the tools provided to you to edit the image. You can even click on the layers within the preview and change their properties. If you prefer to upload your own image, click on the plus icon next to all layers to add a new layer. Then, select "Image" and upload the image from your device.
