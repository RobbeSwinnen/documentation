## Manual Setup
If you're new to using Sapphire on your Discord server, there are a few steps you'll need to take to get started. Don't worry, we're here to guide you through the process.

The first thing you'll need to do is invite Sapphire to your server. To do this, simply click on the "Add to Discord" button on the Sapphire website (https://sapph.xyz/). Please note that you'll need the Manage Server permission in order to add Sapphire to your server.

Once Sapphire has been invited, it's important to check that it has the necessary permissions to function properly. You can do this by going to your server settings and looking for the "Sapphire" bot role under Roles. Drag this role to the top of the list to ensure that Sapphire has the necessary permissions to add and remove roles through buttons, select menus, or reaction roles.

If you encounter any permission issues, you may need to compare your permissions with a list of necessary permissions provided by Sapphire and add any missing permissions.

To manage Sapphire's features, you'll need to use the dashboard. The dashboard is a website that allows you to fully manage Sapphire and all of its features. Simply log in to the dashboard (https://dashboard.sapph.xyz/) with your Discord account and choose your server to begin exploring all of the features available.
