You can modify these messages by navigating to the Messages module and selecting \"Default messages\". From there, you can customize any default message to your liking.","Message kits are packs of edited messages created by other users.

Here, we'll walk you through the steps on how to use the automated moderation module effectively.","Automated Moderation is a powerful feature that can detect specific words, message spam, too many mentions, attachments, emojis, links being sent, and more. You can define conditions and actions that will be executed automatically, such as banning users, deleting messages, adding roles, and more.","There are two categories of Automated Moderation: Discord's built-in Automated Moderation and Advanced Automated Moderation. Let's dive into each of them.","Discord's built-in automated moderation allows you to add additional actions that will be executed when Discord’s AutoMod is triggered. All AutoMod rules you’ve set up on your server show up on this page. This feature gives you more flexibility to enforce your server's rules and prevent unwanted behavior.","Advanced Automated Moderation, on the other hand, is Sapphire’s automated moderation system, which contains 10+ modules. These modules include Spam, Mentions, Attachments, Emojis, Message lines, Capitalization, Words, Links, Invites, Warns, and Special channels. Each of these modules allows you to take actions when specific conditions are met. For example, the Spam module takes actions when a user sends messages too fast, while the Links module takes actions when a user’s message includes links.","Setting up automated moderation modules is easy. To get started, add a condition and configure the requirements that need to be met. A condition works like this: How much .. (messages, attachments/..) in .. (time/how often/how much/..). Once you've set up your conditions, configure the actions that will be executed when the condition is triggered. Click on the + symbol and select an action, such as opening a moderation case or deleting the message.","In addition, you can ignore roles or channels that you do not want the automated moderation feature to apply to. To ignore roles, click the \"Manage roles\" button above the conditions.

Each case includes all the necessary information about the punishment. When you punish a user, a case is created, and you can view all cases using the s!cases command or by navigating to Moderation -> Cases inside the dashboard.","To view a case of a specific user, type s!caseinfo [case id] or s!cases [user] for a list of all cases with that user. The [user] argument refers to an @mention or the user ID.","If a case is temporary, it will expire when the punishment time is up. However, if a case is permanent, it will remain in the user's profile as open. You can close and delete cases at any time, but note that deleting a case will not unpunish the user."]},{"l":"Edit and Close Cases","p":["Cases can be edited and closed at any time. To edit a case using a command, type s!case [case id] or s!caseupdate [user id]. This will display the case's information, and you can edit the reason, length, proof, and moderator note. To close the case, click on the \"Close\" button next to the Edit button, or type s!closecase [case id] [reason].

This message typically includes the username and user ID of the affected user, as well as the type of punishment that was administered (e.g., \"User#1000 has been banned\").","On the other hand, \"direct message details\" pertain to the information message sent directly to the user via direct message. This message typically informs the user of the type of punishment they have received (e.g., \"You have been muted\").","By being mindful of what information is displayed to users, you can ensure that user privacy is maintained, and users feel secure in using your application. Remember to carefully consider which details are necessary to display, and which can be withheld without impacting the user experience."]}],[{"l":"Social Media Notifications","p":["Welcome to Sapphire's Social Media Notifications feature!

Note that legacy username IDs cannot be used and that only randomly generated channel IDs work with Sapphire.","To set up Twitch notifications, you'll need to connect your Twitch account with Sapphire. Simply type in your username, follow the on-screen instructions to connect your account, and you're all set! Note that this process must be done only once and is necessary for legal reasons.","To receive Twitter notifications, you'll need to connect your Twitter account with Sapphire in the same way as you did with Twitch.

You can also set a delay time in seconds before Sapphire assigns the user a role.","Furthermore, if Sapphire was offline or unable to assign roles at any point, you can use the Synchronization feature to assign all currently selected roles to every user in the server.

For example, if you set your Spam condition to ≥ 5 messages in 10 seconds with \"Delete all\" enabled, it will delete every message from the first message that triggered the condition to the last.","But that's not all. With Custom Branding, you get an entire bot that's hosted just for you. This means you have exclusive control over your bot and its features. And the best part? It starts at just €5 per month. With this, you get access to everything Sapphire offers, including a completely customizable bot's appearance.","Difference Between Caseclose and Unpunish Command","Firstly, let's take a look at banAdd. This log type is triggered when a new moderation case is created, and it sends the default message logBan. The logBan message contains all the necessary information that an admin needs to know about the user who has been banned. This information includes proof, verified proof, duration, reason, name, user ID, and case ID. As you can see, this log type provides a comprehensive overview of the ban, making it easy for admins to keep track of moderation cases.","Firstly, the caseclose command is used to close a specific case by its unique case ID. To execute this command, simply type s!caseclose [reason]. This is particularly useful when you want to close only one specific case.","If you want to contribute to the verification process, you can also use the \"Reply to message to punish\" feature. Simply reply to a message with a punish command, such as s!warn, and the user's message will be used as verified proof. Please note that this feature must be enabled under Moderation -> Punish settings.","If you want to learn more about how Custom Branding can benefit your business, head over to https://sapph.xyz/custom-branding. there's a wealth of information that can help you make an informed decision.","If you're new to moderating a server, you might be wondering what the difference is between the log types banAdd and guildBanAdd. Both log types are related to banning a user, but they provide different levels of information.","If you're wondering about the difference between caseclose and unpunish commands when it comes to handling user punishments, this article is for you!","In summary, the main difference between these two commands is that caseclose is used to close a specific case by its unique ID, while unpunish commands close all open cases of the same punishment type for a specific user. Now that you know the difference, you can choose which command to use depending on your needs.","It's also worth noting that both log types will be triggered if you have the feature enabled and someone is banned from the server. However, guildBanAdd will only be triggered for bans that are not part of a moderation case.","On the other hand, \"Delete overflow\" option will only delete the messages that exceeded the condition, which means the messages that triggered the condition after the threshold has already been reached. For instance, if someone sends 10 messages while only 5 are allowed, the bot will only delete the last 5 messages that exceeded the condition.","On the other hand, guildBanAdd is triggered when someone has been banned from the server. This log type provides less information than banAdd, and the message logguildbanadd only includes the name, user ID, and reason for the ban. Although this log type provides less information, it is still useful for keeping track of banned users.","On the other hand, unpunish commands (unwarn, unban, and unmute) are designed to close all open/active cases of a user from the same type of punishment. For example, using s!unwarn @Xge will close all open warnings for the user Xge, which is a helpful solution when you want to close multiple cases at once.","Proof is evidence that supports a moderation case. You can manually add proof to a case by using the s!setproof [proof] command or by editing an existing case and entering new proof. This helps moderators keep track of important information and make informed decisions.","So, what exactly is Custom Branding? It's a fantastic feature that allows you to personalize your bot in a way that suits your needs. With Sapphire, you can customize your bot's name, avatar, status, and about me section. This means you can tailor the bot's appearance and persona to match your brand's image and tone.","The difference between the \"Delete all\" and \"Delete overflow\" options in our system. Let us explain it in simple terms.","Verified proof, on the other hand, is proof that is added automatically by our system. When a user triggers the auto-moderation module and condition, Sapphire adds verified proof to the case to confirm that the user did indeed write the flagged word or phrase.","We hope this explanation helps you understand the difference between banAdd and guildBanAdd.
